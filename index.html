<h3>A New Innovative Project</h3>
    <p>
        I am proposing a new <strong>Innovative project pioneered by ISP and led by 
          myself</strong> which would benefit both students and teachers, making it 
          an invaluable resource for academic growth and personalised support. 
          By addressing the needs of second language learners, providing opportunities 
          for the shyer students, and allowing for seamless understanding between parents 
        and educators, this new project fosters a truly inclusive, accessible, and 
        empowering learning environment.
